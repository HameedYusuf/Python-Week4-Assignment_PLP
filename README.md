## Python File I/O Practice 

This repository contains Python code to practice reading from and writing to files. 

###   File Read & Write Challenge

This script demonstrates how to read the content of a file, modify it, and write the modified content to a new file. 

**Features:**

- Reads a file specified by the user.
- Modifies the content (example: adds a line).
- Writes the modified content to a new file named "modified_<original_filename>".
- Includes error handling to gracefully handle situations where the file cannot be found or there are issues reading/writing the file.

###  Error Handling Lab

This script incorporates error handling to ensure the program runs smoothly even if the user enters an invalid filename or there are issues accessing the file.

**Error Handling:**

- Handles `FileNotFoundError` if the specified file doesn't exist.
- Handles general `IOError` for other I/O related issues.

###   Outcomes

By working with this code, you'll gain experience in:

-  Opening, reading, writing, and closing files in Python.
-  Implementing error handling to make your code more robust.
-  Understanding basic file manipulation techniques.


### How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:

```
python read_and_modify_file.py
```

4. The script will prompt you to enter the filename.
